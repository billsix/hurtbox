This is a fairly straightforward port of gl-matrix.js (https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix)
from JavaScript to C.

To compile and install on UNIX systems, run from your terminal:

    make
    sudo make install

The library will be installed under /usr/local/lib and the headers at 
/usr/local/include. If you need to install it elsewhere, just edit the Makefile.

To use the library after installation, include the gl-matrix.h file:

    #include <gl-matrix.h>

And use the -lgl-matrix flag on your compiler:

    clang -lgl-matrix main.c 

If you want to include this library directly in your IDE project (it's probably
the easiest way to get this working on Windows w/ Visual Studio) you can simply
copy all the .c and .h files to your project directory, and add them normally.

Known issues:

- The documentation still uses some JavaScript nomenclature from the original 
version of the library.
