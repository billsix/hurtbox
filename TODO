- Build correctly via cmake
  - ensure that the models/textures/shaders are loaded correctly (i.e. have the correct path) regardless of directory of hurtbox invocation
  - don't export .h files, as this is an app, not a library
  - take a look to see if cmake subprojects are actually needed for single-file header libraries from within contrib
