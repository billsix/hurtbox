Building-
  Download a git client.  On Windows, the GitHub plugin for Visual Studio works
  well enough.

  If using git on the command line on linux/windows/osx,
  in the current directory, run "git submodule init" and then "git submodule update".
  This will download the remaining necessary source code from the "Dear IMGUI" project.
  Using GitHub plugin for Windows, the plugin will take care of the submodules.

        automake

          and CPPFLAGS to have the correct include directory for use
          at ``configure'' time.
      To build -
        $ ./autogen.sh
        $ ./configure --prefix=$MY_INSTALL_DIR
        $ make
        $ make install
  
    Windows 10
      Prereqs - Visual Studio 15 (I have Community Edition)
      To build
        Both the SDL source code and the GLEW source code has been included,
        intended for building on Windows exclusively.
        Firstly, open the Visual Studio solution for SDL.sln, and build it.
        Secondly, do the same for GLEW.  I updated the VC12 solution to
        be used in VS Community 15.
        Then, open the "HurtBox.sln" and build it.
        Make sure that you build it with the correct profiles (i.e., if you
        build SDL and GLEW in debug mode for x86_64, do the same for HurtBox)
