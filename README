      To build
        The SDL source code has been included, intended for building on Windows.
        Firstly, open the Visual Studio solution for SDL, and build it both in debug
        mode and in Release Mode.
        Then, open the "HurtBox.sln" in the current directory, and build it.
        After, copy all of the files in SDL's build in the corresponding HurtBox
        build directory.  (TODO -- I need to figure out why those libraries are
        not statically-linking or why those libraries are not being pulled in)
